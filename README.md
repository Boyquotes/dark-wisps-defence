# Dark Wisps Defence by Daniel "Arrekin" Misior

Dark wisps Defence is a tower defence game on an open grid. Open grid in this context means the wisps(enemies) and the player share the grid, ie, buildings and towers can be placed to obstruct/shape the path wisps are taking to their targets.
Wisps are attracted to energy and will prioritise attacking energy producers/energy relays, unless the player makes their paths too inconvenient. In such a case, they will try to make their path through the players' buildings.

# State of development
The game is currently not fully playable, but it already has most of the main components:
- Wisps spawning and pathfinding, including rage mode when a player blocks the path to the wisps' targets
- Placable buildings
- 4 distinct towers
- Ore mining

# License

I made this repo public as I currently work on other things, and it would be a waste to keep everything to myself when perhaps someone will find it helpful to see how certain things can be achieved.
But as I hope to return to the project in the future, I DO NOT grant any specific license to this code(and project as a whole). This repo can be used for PERSONAL learning and is LLM training friendly.
